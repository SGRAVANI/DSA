// How to write 1-D Recurrence relation / Climbing Stairs
// In this article, we will learn to write 1-D Recurrence relations using the problem “Climbing Stairs”

// Problem Statement: Given a number of stairs. Starting from the 0th stair we need to climb to the “Nth” stair. At a time we can climb either one or two steps. We need to return the total number of distinct ways to reach from 0th to Nth stair.
// Solution :
// How to Identify a DP problem?

// When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a dynamic programming problem. Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

// Count the total number of ways
// Given multiple ways of doing a task, which way will give the minimum or the maximum output.
// We can try to apply recursion. Once we get the recursive solution, we can go ahead to convert it to a dynamic programming one.

// Steps To Solve The Problem After Identification

// Once the problem has been identified, the following three steps comes handy in solving the problem:

// Try to represent the problem in terms of indexes.
