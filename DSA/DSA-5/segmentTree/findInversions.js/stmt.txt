Problem Description
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Input format
First line contains N, indicating the number of elements in the nums array.

Next line contains N space separated integers.

Output format
Print N space separated integers, representing the counts array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5

|nums[i]| <= 10^5

Sample Input 1
4

5 2 6 1

Sample Output 1
2 1 1 0

Explanation 1
nums[0] is 5 → 2 and 1 are smaller, answer is 2

nums[1] is 2 → 1 is smaller, answer is 1

nums[2] is 6 → 1 is smaller, answer is 1

nums[3] is 1 → there is no element smaller than 1, answer is 0

Sample Input 2
5

3 1 3 1 4

Sample Output 2
2 0 1 0 0

Explanation 2
nums[0] is 3 → 1 and 1 are smaller, answer is 2

nums[1] is 1 → there is no element smaller than 1 to its right, answer is 0

nums[2] is 3 → 1 is smaller, answer is 1

nums[3] is 1 → there is no element smaller than 1 to its right, answer is 0

nums[4] is 4 → there is no element smaller than 4 to its right answer is 0
